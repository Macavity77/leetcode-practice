From Interview:

1. Why you choose blackstone over us?
The internship at Blackstone was a very very good experience. 
It not only put me into a industrial environment to hone my professional coding skills,
with hand-on experience of working on a full-stack within a giant project.

But also, gave me the ability to get to know the working culture there. Especially communication
. Which can help me move further in the tech company(certain name here please). Because you have to 
code well, but you also have to have the ability to communicate well with you team member, business people
and also you manager. Communication is also very important.

This experience is a base. Being a software engineer at a Tech company is better for personal growth.
Both for career and techniqual ability. 

With the experience at Blackstone, I feel more confident to take this challenge.
